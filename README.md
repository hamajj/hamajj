# Hi, I'm Hamza 👋

🧑‍💻 13 y/o middle school student  
🚀 Hobbyist software developer who takes programming seriously  
🧠 Focused on long-term self-improvement

## 🛠️ Languages

- **C** – performance-oriented and low-level thinking  
- **Go** – clean, fast, and practical  
- **Python** – scripting, prototyping, and algorithm practice  
- **JavaScript** – basic knowledge

---

## 🧠 Interests

- Algorithms & data structures  
- Problem solving  
- Performance-aware coding  
- Game development  
- Linux & open-source

---

## 📐 My Approach to Algorithms

- I focus on understanding the problem before coding  
- I start with a simple solution, then optimize it  
- I care about time and memory complexity  
- I prefer learning the logic instead of copy-pasting solutions

---

## 📚 Currently Working On

- Algorithm practice  
- Deeper knowledge of C and Go  
- Building small tools and projects

---

## 🎯 Goal

> Not to memorize languages, but to truly learn **algorithmic thinking**.

I aim to become a developer with strong fundamentals and language-independent skills.
